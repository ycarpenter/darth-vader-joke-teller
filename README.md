## In this project I'll practiced:

- [async function](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions) that allow using [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) without [callback function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function);
- [fetch() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) that provides to fetch resources asynchronously across the network;
- [text-to-speech API](https://rapidapi.com/voicerss/api/text-to-speech-1) that allows conversion of textual content to speech.
